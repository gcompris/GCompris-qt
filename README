GCompris is a high quality educational software suite, including a large 
number of activities for children aged 2 to 10. Some of the activities
are game orientated, but nonetheless still educational.

Currently GCompris offers in excess of 100 activities and more are
being developed. GCompris is free software, that means that you can
adapt it to your own needs, improve it and, most importantly, share it
with children everywhere.

This version is a full rewrite of GCompris using the QtQuick technology.
