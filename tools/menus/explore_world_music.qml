In the first level, enjoy exploring music from around the world. Click on each suitcase to learn about the music from that area, and listen to a short sample. Study well, because there will be two games related to this information next!

The second level is a matching game. You will hear a clip of music, and you must select the location that corresponds to that music. Click the play button if you'd like to hear the music again. You win the level when you have correctly matched all sound clips.
