This directory contains useful tools for translators.

As the Qt Quick version is a rewrite of the Gtk+ version, we keep in
the file 'gcompris_template.ts' the original strings. This way we can
create of update a po file with the strings we had in the Gtk+
version.

When updated from the latest version tho translation file will have
many fuzzy strings but it is easier to start a translation with this.
