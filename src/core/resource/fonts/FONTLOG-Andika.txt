FONTLOG
Andika
==========================


This file provides detailed information on the Andika family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Andika fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms
that will not be easily confused with one another.

A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some
serif fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do
with fonts that were available but not really suitable for beginning
readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to
tediously cobble together letters from a variety of fonts in order to
get the all of characters they need for their particular language
project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika
addresses those issues.

After receiving many insightful comments on the Design Review and Basic
fonts, we have refined Andika's final letterforms, with alternate shapes
still available for some characters. 

With the SIL TypeTuner utility (see http://scripts.sil.org/TypeTuner),
you can select which alternates to use as Andika's default letterforms.

This font now contains the same character set as Charis SIL and
Doulos SIL.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Andika Regular

Work is ongoing to provide italic, bold and bold-italic weights.

Features
--------

Andika supports all of the smart font features that the Doulos SIL
font supports. It also contains features specific to Andika. 
These are:
   Capital Q alternate
   Lower case j serif alternate
   Lower case q alternate
   No-tail t and y alternates
   Numeral 0 1 4 6 7 9 alternates
   Tail i and l alternates

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Andika" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Andika.
However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Andika" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Andika Non-Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Andika" or "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like 
"Write Sans".
