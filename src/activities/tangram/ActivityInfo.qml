  goal: qsTr("From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Tangram (Chinese: literally 'seven boards of cunning') is a Chinese puzzle. While the tangram is often said to be ancient, its existence has only been verified as far back as 1800. It consists of 7 pieces, called tans, which fit together to form a square; Using the square side as 1 unit, the 7 pieces contains:
    5 right isosceles triangles, including:
        - 2 small size ones (legs of 1)
        - 1 medium size (legs of square root of 2)
        - 2 large size (legs of 2)
    1 square (side of 1) and
    1 parallelogram (sides of 1 and square root of 2)
    ")
  prerequisite: qsTr("Mouse-manipulation")
  manual: qsTr("Select the tangram to form. Move a piece by dragging it. The symmetrical button appears on items that supports it. Click on the rotation button or drag around it to show the rotation you want. At first levels, simpler objects are used to introduce the tangram concept.")
