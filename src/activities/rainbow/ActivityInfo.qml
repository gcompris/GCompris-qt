  title: qsTr("Decomposition of light(Rainbows)")
  description: qsTr("This activity describes the formation of rainbow and explanation of its colors.When white light passes through the prism,it gets dispersed into seven colors(Violet,Indigo,Blue,Red,Yellow,Orange,Red)")
  goal: qsTr("Understand the concept of Dispersion of light")
  prerequisite: qsTr("Rules of reflection and refraction of light")
  manual:qsTr ("Water vapour cools to form cloud and when they become bulk,they rain. Click on  clouds to start rain. When there is rain, clouds become light and due to this sun which was hidden rises back.For sun click on leftmost sun image.Due to sun,the water droplets present in the air get stuck by ray of light,thus causing decomposition of light causing formation of rainbow.Rainbow is composed of seven colors (Violet, Indigo ,Blue, Green ,Yellow ,Orange and Red).This is how rainbows are created.To see the rainbow effect closely click on the rainbow at the leftmost screen,and, it will show how water droplets acts as a prism to incoming sunlight and cause decomposition of sunlight into seven colors.")
