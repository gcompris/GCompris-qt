    manual: qsTr("Checkers is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard. One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces. Players alternate turns. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.
Only the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. Capturing is mandatory. The player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.
When a man reaches the crownhead or kings row (the farthest row forward), it becomes a king, and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man, and acquires additional powers including the ability to move backwards. If there is a piece in a diagonal that a king can capture, he can move any distance along the diagonal, and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it.
