  manual: qsTr("The factors of a number are all the numbers that divide that number evenly. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. 4 is not a factor of 6 because 6 cannot be divided into 4 equal pieces. If one number is a multiple of a second number, then the second number is a factor of the first number. You can think of multiples as families, and factors are the people in those families. So 1, 2, 3 and 6 all fit into the 6 family, but 4 belongs to another family.") +
