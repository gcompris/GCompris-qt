  manual: qsTr("A set of cards is shown. Each card has an associated sound, and each sound has a twin exactly the same. Click on a card to see its hidden sound, and try to match the twins. You can only activate two cards at once, so you need to remember where a sound is, while you listen to its twin. When you turn over the twins, they both disappear.")
