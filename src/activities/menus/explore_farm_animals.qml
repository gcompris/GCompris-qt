In level one, players enjoy exploring each animal on the screen. Click on the question mark, and learn about the animal, what it's name is, what sound it makes, and what it looks like. Study well this information, because you will be tested in level 2 and 3!

In level two, a random animal sound is played and you must choose which animal makes that sound. Click on the question mark that corresponds to the animal you hear. If you'd like to hear the animal sound repeated, click on the play button. When you have matched all animals correctly, you win!

In level three, a random text prompt is displayed and you must click on the animal that matches the text. When you have matched all texts correctly, you win!
